## � Enhanced AI Analysis

### Dual-Model Architecture

The system employs a sophisticated dual-model approach for comprehensive security analysis:

#### Primary Vision Model: Gemma 3 4B
- **High-Resolution Processing**: Analyzes frames at 1024x1024 pixels for maximum detail
- **Batch Intelligence**: Processes 4 sequential frames simultaneously for temporal context
- **Visual Understanding**: Advanced scene description and object relationship analysis
- **Scope**: Exclusively handles visual content analysis

#### Secondary Processing Model: Gemma 3n e4b  
- **Consolidation Engine**: Synthesizes multiple batch summaries into coherent narratives
- **Security Specialization**: Focused on threat pattern recognition and risk assessment
- **Classification System**: Multi-level threat categorization (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Keyword Extraction**: Intelligent tagging for searchable security events
- **Confidence Scoring**: Reliability metrics for decision-making support

### Intelligent Batch Processing

The system uses an optimized batch processing approach for video analysis:

1. **Frame Extraction**: Systematically extracts frames every 2 seconds from 60-second clips
2. **Batch Grouping**: Groups frames into batches of 4 images for contextual processing  
3. **Parallel Analysis**: Processes multiple batches simultaneously using ThreadPoolExecutor
4. **Temporal Context**: AI analyzes frame sequences to detect movement patterns and behaviors
5. **Consolidation**: All batch summaries are intelligently merged using Gemma 3n e4b

### Performance Benefits

- **75% Reduction in API Calls**: 4 images per call instead of individual processing
- **Enhanced Temporal Awareness**: AI sees relationships and movement patterns between frames
- **3x Faster Processing**: Parallel batch execution dramatically reduces analysis time
- **Superior Accuracy**: Consolidated view provides more reliable threat assessment
- **Anti-Hallucination System**: Strict validation prevents AI from inventing false details
- **Optimized Model Usage**: Vision model for images, text model for consolidation

### Analysis Structure & Quality Assurance

#### Batch Analysis Format

```json
{
  "batch_number": 1,
  "frame_range": {"start": 1, "end": 4},
  "timestamp_range": {"start_seconds": 0, "end_seconds": 6},
  "frames_in_batch": 4,
  "resolution": "1024x1024",
  "batch_summary": "Comprehensive description of activity across all frames in batch",
  "processing_method": "dual_model_analysis",
  "vision_model": "gemma3:4b",
  "consolidation_model": "gemma3n:e4b"
}
```

#### Anti-Hallucination Measures

The system includes strict prompts to prevent AI hallucination:
- **Explicit instructions** to only describe what is actually visible in frames
- **Conservative language** requirements for uncertain observations
- **Factual reporting** emphasis over speculative analysis
- **Dual-model validation** for cross-verification of assessments
- **Model specialization** preventing vision models from doing text-only tasks

- Ensure RTSP port is accessible

**Ollama Not Responding:**
- Verify Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Check model is pulled: `ollama list`
- Verify Ollama URL in configuration

**Person Detection Not Working:**
- Check MobileNet models in `models/` directory
- Run `python setup_models.py`
- System will fallback to Haar Cascade

**FFmpeg Errors:**
- Ensure FFmpeg is installed and in PATH
- Check RTSP stream compatibility
- Verify write permissions to recordings directory

### Getting Help

1. Check the logs in `logs/` directory
2. Run with DEBUG log level
3. Verify all dependencies are installed
4. Check configuration file
